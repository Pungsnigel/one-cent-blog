My name is Jesper Lugner. Here I write about my various fields of interest; programming, finance and ice cream. The occasional movie review might show up as well. I switch between Swedish and English depending on the topic at hand.

This site is completely open source ([Source code][source]), and was created using the setup created by my friend Hugo Tunius, instructions found [here][one-cent-blog]. I hope you like it!

Jesper
